## About Me

I am a Theoretical Physicist and Data Scientist with expertise in String Theory and Cosmology. I have a passion for solving complex problems using data-driven approaches and have published several papers in top-tier journals. My research includes string compactification, moduli stabilization, and string phenomenology related to inflation, dark energy, and dark matter.

## Education

- **PhD in Theoretical Physics** (2021 - 2024)
  - Alma Mater Studiorum, Università di Bologna, Bologna
  - Focus: Early and Late-Time Cosmology of Type IIB Flux Compactifications

- **Master Degree in Theoretical Physics** (2019 - 2021)
  - Alma Mater Studiorum, Università di Bologna, Bologna
  - Focus: Classification of Flat Directions in Type IIB Toroidal Flux Compactifications

- **Bachelor in Physics** (2015 - 2018)
  - Università degli Studi di Cagliari, Cagliari
  - Focus: Information Paradox

## Research and Projects

- Conducted advanced research on Type IIB flux compactifications, leading to the publication of 4 papers in the Journal of High Energy Physics (JHEP), published by Springer. \href{https://link.springer.com/search?dc.creator=Matteo%20Licheri}{\textbf{\textcolor{black}{[Complete List]}}}
- Demonstrated strong communication skills by presenting findings at international conferences and workshops, including the Workshop on Multifield Cosmology at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, Stony Brook, USA, and serving as the corresponding author for one of the published papers.
